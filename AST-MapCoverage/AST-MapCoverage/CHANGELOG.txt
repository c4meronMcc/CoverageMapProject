Todo: 
- A colour reset button to refresh the map.
- A pin icon to appear at the users mouse click location. 

Errors need fixing:
- Users can click on a conutry or sea and it registers mouse click but doesnt change fill color.

Fixed/Changed: 
- The issue with the background changing color when you click a sea area that has not yet been defined with image mapping.
- The sea areas turn blue when clicked and when you click another sea area the previous one turns grey again.
- Israel and West bank did not have the correct SVG code and so when clicked the borders expanded but there was no fill property so didnt not fill as green.
- Sea/Land didn't turn grey again when the opposite of one is clicked.
- When user moves the map a country/sea area was also clicked as the mouse was released.
- Luxembourg is coloured in as a sea area not a land area. Needs to be filled in as land grey colour.
